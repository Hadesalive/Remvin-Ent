**Date:** 2024  
**Platform:** React Native (Expo)

---

## Executive Summary

## 1. Authentication & User Management

### 1.1 Authentication
- **Username/Password Login**
  - Authentication using existing `users` table in Supabase
  - Password verification against `password_hash` field (matching desktop app architecture)
  - Custom authentication endpoint/function in Supabase to verify password hash
  - Session persistence with AsyncStorage/SecureStore
  - Session expiry management (12-hour sessions matching desktop)
  - Remember me functionality
  - Last login timestamp update on successful login
  - User must be active (`is_active = 1`) to login

**Implementation Note:** 
- The mobile app should authenticate against the `users` table directly via Supabase
- Password hashing uses SHA-256 (matching desktop app: `crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password).digest('hex')`)
- Create a Supabase Edge Function or use RPC to verify passwords server-side
- This maintains consistency with the existing desktop architecture rather than using Supabase Auth
- User must be active (`is_active = 1`) to login

### 1.2 User Profile
- View user profile information
- View/edit user details (name, email, phone)
